### Crater Dog Technlogies™ HSM Prototype
This project provides a working prototype of the **wearable** part of the Crater Dog Technologies™
[Wearable Identity System™](https://craterdog.com/Identity.html).  It includes C++ code that can be
uploaded to an [Adafruit BLE nRF52 feather board](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3406) to create
the **prototype** [hardware security module](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardware_security_module)
(HSM) code named "ArmorD™". A hardened production version of ArmorD™ could then be embedded in a
wearable device like a ring, pendant or fob.
