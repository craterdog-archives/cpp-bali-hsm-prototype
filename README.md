### Bali Nebula™ HSM Prototype
This project provides a C++ implementation of a _hardware security module_ (HSM) that can be uploaded to an [Adafruit BLE nRF52 Feather Board](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3406). The code implements the peripheral side of the security protocol defined in the [Bali Digital Notary™](https://github.com/craterdog-bali/js-bali-digital-notary) project. Specifically, it can be used with the [HSM proxy module](https://github.com/craterdog-bali/js-bali-digital-notary/blob/master/src/v1/HSM.js) running on nodeJS.
