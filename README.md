### Bali Nebula™ HSM Prototype
This project provides a C++ **prototype** implementation of a _hardware security module_ (HSM)
that can be uploaded to an [Adafruit BLE nRF52 Feather Board](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3406).
The code implements the peripheral side of the security protocol defined in the
[Bali HSM Proxy](https://github.com/craterdog-bali/js-bali-hsm-proxy/wiki) project.
Specifically, it can be used with the
[HSM proxy module](https://github.com/craterdog-bali/js-bali-hsm-proxy/blob/master/src/v1/HSMProxy.js)
running on nodeJS.
